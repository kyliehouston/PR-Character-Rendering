# PR-Character-Rendering

## 2D to 3D Photorealistic character rending project for a class

### Python scripts written for both female and male characters, where bodily proportions differ based on Andrew Loomis' anatomical diagrams.
### Utilizes nearest-neighbor interpolation to resize 2D pixelated characters to human proportion ratios between body parts and height.
### Newly proportioned images serve as layer over which to create photorealistic characters in a photo editing software
### These final images are cast into Blender 3D world, where UV spheres are placed and molded based on cross-referenced profile and side images.
### Coloring, shadow, and lighting were tweaked to create a more pleasing image.
